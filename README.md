📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation of K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch to group data points into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm widely used for pattern recognition, customer segmentation, image compression, and exploratory data analysis.

The implementation focuses on clarity, mathematical intuition, and step-by-step execution of the algorithm.
